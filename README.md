# 📰 Fake News Blockchain

A Python-based blockchain project for securely storing and verifying **fake news entries**.
This project demonstrates the use of blockchain technology for immutable storage of information, ensuring transparency, security, and traceability.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create a **simple blockchain system** in Python that can:

* Store fake news articles or claims.
* Ensure that once a piece of information is recorded, it cannot be altered.
* Provide a tamper-proof ledger of fake news entries.
* Demonstrate how blockchain principles (hashing, proof-of-work, chaining) can be applied in real-world data validation.

This project is purely for **educational and research purposes**, helping students and developers understand blockchain fundamentals in the context of **misinformation tracking**.

## ⚙️ Features

* ✅ Implementation of a basic blockchain in Python.
* ✅ Blocks containing fake news entries with timestamps, data, and hashes.
* ✅ Proof-of-Work mechanism for block validation.
* ✅ Chain integrity check (detects tampering attempts).
* ✅ Simple API/CLI for adding and retrieving fake news data.

## 🛠️ Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/fake-news-blockchain.git
   cd fake-news-blockchain
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # Linux/Mac
   venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## ▶️ Usage

### 1. Run the Blockchain Script

```bash
python blockchain.py
```

### 2. Start Flask API (optional)

```bash
python app.py
```

Then open in your browser:

```
http://127.0.0.1:5000/
```

### Example API Routes

* `POST /add_news` → Add a new fake news entry
* `GET /chain` → View the full blockchain

## 📖 How It Works

1. Each **block** contains:

   * Index
   * Timestamp
   * Fake news data
   * Previous block hash
   * Current block hash
   * Proof of Work

2. When new data is added:

   * A new block is created.
   * Hashes are generated to secure the block.
   * Proof of Work validates the block before adding it to the chain.

3. Any tampering attempt will break the hash chain and be immediately detectable.

## 🎯 Future Improvements

* 🔹 Implement consensus algorithms (e.g., Proof of Stake).
* 🔹 Add user authentication and roles.
* 🔹 Create a frontend dashboard for easier interaction.
* 🔹 Integrate machine learning models for fake news detection.
